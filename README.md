# Figma plugin starter

- Open `manifest.ts` and change the plugin `name` and `id`. You can get your `id` from Figma when creating a new plugin.
- Run `yarn && yarn build`
- Import your plugin into Figma from `dist/manifest.json`
- For development, run `yarn dev` which will enable hot-reloading of the plugin UI
